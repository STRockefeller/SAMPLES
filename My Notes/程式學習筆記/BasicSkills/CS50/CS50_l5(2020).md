### Resizing arrays

提到增加array的大小有可能遇到後方記憶體已經被占用的情況，此時就要搬遷array的位置 **略**

### Data Structures

> - **Data structures** are more complex ways to organize data in memory, allowing us to store information in different layouts.

>  - `.` to access properties in a structure
>   - `*` to go to an address in memory pointed to by a pointer
>   - `->` to access properties in a structure pointed to by a pointer

### Linked list

簡單的介紹，然後用struct實作

```C
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;
```

### Implementing arrays

實現resize array

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Use malloc to allocate enough space for an array with 3 integers
    int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    // Set the values in our array
    list[0] = 1;
    list[1] = 2;
    list[2] = 3;

    // Now if we want to store another value, we can allocate more memory
    int *tmp = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
    if (tmp == NULL)
    {
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy list of size 3 into list of size 4
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        tmp[i] = list[i];
    }

    // Add new number to list of size 4
    tmp[3] = 4;

    // Free original list of size 3
    free(list);

    // Remember new list of size 4
    list = tmp;

    // Print list
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        printf("%i\n", list[i]);
    }

    // Free new list
    free(list);
}
```

### Implementing Linked List

實現Linked List

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Represents a node
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;

int main(void)
{
    // List of size 0. We initialize the value to NULL explicitly, so there's
    // no garbage value for our list variable
    node *list = NULL;

    // Allocate memory for a node, n
    node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    // Set the value and pointer in our node
    n->number = 1;
    n->next = NULL;

    // Add node n by pointing list to it, since we only have one node so far
    list = n;

    // Allocate memory for another node, and we can reuse our variable n to
    // point to it, since list points to the first node already
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }

    // Set the values in our new node
    n->number = 2;
    n->next = NULL;

    // Update the pointer in our first node to point to the second node
    list->next = n;

    // Allocate memory for a third node
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (n == NULL)
    {
        // Free both of our other nodes
        free(list->next);
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }
    n->number = 3;
    n->next = NULL;

    // Follow the next pointer of the list to the second node, and update
    // the next pointer there to point to n
    list->next->next = n;

    // Print list using a loop, by using a temporary variable, tmp, to point
    // to list, the first node. Then, every time we go over the loop, we use
    // tmp = tmp->next to update our temporary pointer to the next node. We
    // keep going as long as tmp points to somewhere, stopping when we get to
    // the last node and tmp->next is null.
    for (node *tmp = list; tmp != NULL; tmp = tmp->next)
    {
        printf("%i\n", tmp->number);
    }

    // Free list, by using a while loop and a temporary variable to point
    // to the next node before freeing the current one
    while (list != NULL)
    {
        // We point to the next node first
        node *tmp = list->next;
        // Then, we can free the first node
        free(list);
        // Now we can set the list to point to the next node
        list = tmp;
        // If list is null, when there are no nodes left, our while loop will stop
    }
}
```

### Trees

> - Notice that we now visualize this data structure in two dimensions (even though the nodes in memory can be at any location).
> - And we can implement this with a more complex version of a node in a linked list, where each node has not one but two pointers to other nodes. All the values to the left of a node are smaller, and all the values of nodes to the right are greater, which allows this to be used as a **binary search tree**. And the data structure is itself defined recursively, so we can use recursive functions to work with it.
> - Each node has at most two **children**, or nodes it is pointing to.
> - And like a linked list, we’ll want to keep a pointer to just the beginning of the list, but in this case we want to point to the **root**, or top center node of the tree (the 4).

實作

```C
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
}
node;
```

```C
// tree is a pointer to a node that is the root of the tree we're searching in.
// number is the value we're trying to find in the tree.
bool search(node *tree, int number)
{
    // First, we make sure that the tree isn't NULL, if we've reached a node
    // on the bottom, or if our tree is entirely empty
    if (tree == NULL)
    {
        return false;
    }
    // If we're looking for a number that's less than the tree's number,
    // search the left side, using the node on the left as the new root
    else if (number < tree->number)
    {
        return search(tree->left, number);
    }
    // Otherwise, search the right side, using the node on the right as the new root
    else if (number > tree->number)
    {
        return search(tree->right, number);
    }
    // Finally, we've found the number we're looking for, so we can return true.
    // We can simplify this to just "else", since there's no other case possible
    else if (number == tree->number)
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```

> With a binary search tree, we’ve incurred the cost of even more memory, since each node now needs space for a value and two pointers. Inserting a new value would take O(log *n*) time, since we need to find the nodes that it should go between.

## Quiz 5

![](https://i.imgur.com/pNsimSp.png)

```Ans
(a) can use binary search
	less memory used
(b) easy to add/ remove an element
	donot need to consider if the next memory has been used or not
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/GovQS44.png)

```Ans
Since usually we don't need to read all the value in hash table to find our target,but linked list does.
