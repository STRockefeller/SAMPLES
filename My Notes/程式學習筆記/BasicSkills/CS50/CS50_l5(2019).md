## Lecture 5 (2019)

2020的CS50已經追到最新進度了Lecture 5，對照2019的課綱大概到Lecture 4的內容，所以這邊接著2019的Lecture 5繼續下去

### Networking

節錄重點

> **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) are two protocols, or rules that specify how computers can communicate with each other. The modern internet relies on these protocols to work.

> Our computers also have addresses that uniquely identify them on the internet, called IP addresses. In IPv4, or version 4 of the protocol, these addresses are numbers in the format `#.#.#.#`, four numbers between 0 and 255 separated by dots. And to represent each number (with 256 possible values), we need exactly 8 bits, and so each IP address is made of 32 bits. But with 32 bits, we can only represent 4 billion values. And since there are more than 4 billion devices connected to the internet, we have a newer version of the protocol, IPv6, which has 128-bit addresses, that the world is starting to transition to.

> A **server**, which is just a computer connected to the internet that can listen for and respond to messages, might provide many services, such as a web site or email. To specify that a message is intended for a particular service, such as web browsing, another number called the port number is added to the address. For example, HTTP, for browsing websites, is usually communicated with port 80. So an envelope with a message might have `1.2.3.4:80` as the destination address, and `5.6.7.8` as the return address. And there are other complexities, but that’s the basics of how computers can communicate over a network.

> 
> Let’s say we wanted to visit a **URL**, Uniform Resource Locator, like `http://www.example.com/`. It turns out that there’s another technology called DNS, Domain Name System, that many internet providers and organizations maintain, which converts domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses.
>
> - There are actually now hundreds of TLDs, top-level domains in addition to `.com`, such as `.net`, `.org`, `.us`, `.uk`, and more.
> - The `www` in front of a domain name is actually a subdomain, and there might be many of them created, each of which pointing to a different server or set of servers. It’s not required, and `www` is only used by convention. For example, MIT uses `web.mit.edu` for their main website’s address.
> - The `/` at the end implies that we’re asking for the root page of the site, which is conventionally `index.html`, where `.html` indicates that the file is written in HTML, a language we’ll soon look at.

> When we type that URL in a browser, our browser first uses DNS to look up the IP address for that domain, and then sends a request (in a virtual envelope) to the right IP address for the website. And when the server at that address responds, it will send us the content of the website in a virtual envelope with our address as the destination.

### HTTP

節錄重點

> - **HTTP**, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is another set of rules and conventions for communicating. For example, humans might have the convention of shaking hands when meeting for the first (or subsequent) times. When our browser communicates to web servers through HTTP, too, both computers follow a protocol for making requests and responses.
>
> - A request for a webpage will look like this:
>
>   ```
>   GET / HTTP/1.1
>   Host: www.example.com
>   ...
>   ```
>
>   - `GET` is an HTTP verb that indicates we want to fetch some resource. The `/` indicates we’re looking for the default page, and `HTTP/1.1` indicates the version of HTTP our browser is using.
>   - Then, `Host: www.example.com` is included, since the same server might be listening for and responding to requests for multiple websites. There are also other pieces of information included in the `...`, to help the server respond to us appropriately.
>
> - The response from the server might look like this:
>
>   ```
>   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
>   Content-Type: text/html
>   ...
>   ```
>
>   - First, we get back the version of HTTP, `HTTP/1.1`. Then, `200` is a numeric code that means `OK`, that the server was able to understand and respond to the request.
>   - `Content-Type: text/html` indicates that the content of the response is in the language called HTML, in text format.

>
> Another HTTP code, `404`, is “Not Found”, and we get that back if we’re trying to get some URL that the server can’t find. These are some interesting ones:
>
> - `200 OK`
> - `301 Moved Permanently`
> - `302 Found`
> - `304 Not Modified`
> - `401 Unauthorized`
> - `403 Forbidden`
> - `404 Not Found`
> - `418 I'm a Teapot`
> - `500 Internal Server Error`
> - `...`

### HTML

前面簡介HTML格式 **略**

後面按照指示使用CS50IDE來實際演練

> - `./` is the current directory, and in this case we are in our `~/workspace/` folder.
> - Then, we see a URL to our IDE’s web server, and since we want to serve these files separately from the IDE itself, the URL ends in `:8080`, indicating that we’re using port number 8080.
> - If we click that link, we’ll see a page that says `Index of /` with the files in our workspace. We can click on `index.html` and see our page. We can also change the code in our editor, save, and refresh to see our changes. Since HTML is interpreted by our browser, we don’t need to compile it.
