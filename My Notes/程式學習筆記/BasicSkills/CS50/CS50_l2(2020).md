### Compiling

解釋上一章節中，我們所使用的cmd語法 `make` 實際上是調用了名為 `clang`的程式，我們也可以透果`clang Hello.c`指令完成compile的動作，此外我們也可以加入更多參數例如`clang -o Hello Hello.c`代表將`Hello.c`編譯為`Hello`(沒寫名稱的話都會編譯為`a.out`)，如果內涵CS50.h的內容需要另外連結CS50 Library 透過在指令後方加入參數 `-lcs50`

> The `-l` flag links the `cs50` file, which is already installed in the CS50 IDE, and includes the machine code for `get_string` (among other functions) that our program can then refer to and use as well.

這邊解釋得很清楚，我就直接貼原文了

> - **Preprocessing** generally involves lines that start with a `#`, like `#include`. For example, `#include <cs50.h>` will tell `clang` to look for that header file, since it contains content that we want to include in our program. Then, `clang` will essentially replace the contents of those header files into our program.

So we end up with one binary file, `a.out` or `hello`, that is the combined machine code for `hello.c`, `cs50.c`, and `stdio.c`. (In the CS50 IDE, precompiled machine code for `cs50.c` and `stdio.c` has already been installed, and `clang` has been configured to find and use them.)

### Debugging

前面是Debug名詞說明，略過不談，後面介紹CS50IDE Debug工具的使用方法

> In the CS50 IDE, we have another tool, **`debug50`**, to help us debug programs. This is a tool written by staff that’s built on a standard tool called `gdb`. Both of these **debuggers** are programs that will run our own programs step-by-step and let us look at variables and other information while our program is running.

### Memory

> - In C, we have different types of variables we can use for storing data, and each of them take up a fixed amount of space. Different computer systems actually vary in the amount of space actually used for each type, but we’ll work with the amounts here, as used in the CS50 IDE:
>   - `bool 1 byte`
>   - `char 1 byte`
>   - `double 8 bytes`
>   - `float 4 bytes`
>   - `int 4 bytes`
>   - `long 8 bytes`
>   - `string ? bytes`
>   - …
> - Inside our computers, we have chips called RAM, random-access **memory**, that stores data for short-term use, like a program’s code while it’s running, or a file while it’s open. We might save a program or file to our hard drive (or SSD, solid state drive) for long-term storage, but use RAM because it is much faster. However, RAM is volatile, or requires power to keep data stored.

### Array

簡單的介紹 **略**

### Char

主要講char 和ASCII的對應關係 **略**

### String

是的，你沒看錯，在C使用string

> **Strings** are actually just arrays of characters, and defined not in C but by the CS50 library. If we had an array called `s`, each character can be accessed with `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and so on.

> And it turns out that a string ends with a special character, `'\0'`, or a byte with all bits set to 0. This character is called the **null character**, or NUL. So we actually need four bytes to store our string with three characters:

> We can use a loop to print out every character in a string:
>
> ```
> #include <cs50.h>
> #include <stdio.h>
> 
> int main(void)
> {
>     string s = get_string("Input:  ");
>     printf("Output: ");
>     for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
>     {
>         printf("%c", s[i]);
>     }
>     printf("\n");
> }
> ```

> 
> We can use a function that comes with C’s `string` library, `strlen`, to get the length of the string for our loop:
>
> ```
> #include <cs50.h>
> #include <stdio.h>
> #include <string.h>
> 
> int main(void)
> {
>     string s = get_string("Input:  ");
>     printf("Output: ");
>     for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)
>     {
>         printf("%c", s[i]);
>     }
>     printf("\n");
> }
> ```

後面還介紹了一些常用的header，這個[手冊](https://manual.cs50.io/)其實整理得不錯，值得收藏。

### Command-line arguments

這個部份我還真不清楚orz

>   - `argc` and `argv` are two variables that our `main` function will now get automatically when our program is run from the command line. `argc` is the *argument count*, or number of arguments, and `argv`, *argument vector* (or argument list), an array of strings.
>   - The first argument, `argv[0]`, is the name of our program (the first word typed, like `./hello`). In this example, we check if we have two arguments, and print out the second one if so.
>   - For example, if we run `./argv David`, we’ll get `hello, David` printed, since we typed in `David` as the second word in our command.

Question 2 of 3

 

Recall that, in lecture, we saw how to write programs in C that support command-line arguments. To do so, we modified the program's main function to take two arguments: `argc` and `argv`.

 

a)  What's a program you've used already in CS50 that accepts command-line arguments? Name the program and describe what the command-line arguments are used for.

b)  What is stored in `argc`? What is its type?

c)   What is stored in `argv`? What is its type?



```Ans
(a) argv.c
(b) int argc => argument count
(c) string[] argv => argument vector
```



![](https://i.imgur.com/nfq9XXK.png)

```Ans
(a) a character array
(b)
int len = 0;
for(int i=0; s[i]!='\0'; i++)
	len++;
(c) Version 2 is more effecient since version 1 calculate the lenght of the string every time, but version 2 do it only at the first time.
```
